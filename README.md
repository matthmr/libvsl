# very small lisp

A very small implementation of lisp, nothing too fancy.

# Building

Run `make vslisp` to compile the project. `make` variables are:

- `CC` - the C compiler
- `CFLAGS` - `CC` major flags
- `CFLAGSADD` - `CC` minor flags

# Motivation

This is just a small side project I did to practice for GPLD. It has a
*LOT* of debugging info that can be exposed through the `-DDEBUG`
compiler flag.

# License

This repository is not licensed under any particular license, use it as you want.
